>〝When you're up on your board, you're alive, safe in the stillness of summer, speeding towards the infinite. There is no reward or prize. Nothing to chase or find. You're already there. Gliding across the sea. That's when perfection happens. That's when time stopsand your heart opens. And it may only be for a second, but once it collapses, all you need to do is paddle out and capture it all over again. And again. And again. And again.〞

# Welcome to my Homebreak

嗨，我是Kermit，歡迎來到我的數位花園 Homebreak。在這裡，我希望盡可能探索、整合各種筆記流程，諸如 readwise、october(kobo highlight)、obsidian 等工具，隨手紀錄下日常生活中突如其來的想法，可能紀錄些衝浪相關，可能紀錄各種讀後心得、日常，也不排斥產出技術相關文章，總之就是實現 ~~(折騰)~~ 一套個人的懶惰筆記流程，紀錄生活種種。
