> When you're up on your board, you're alive, safe in the stillness of summer, speeding towards the infinite. There is no reward or prize. Nothing to chase or find. You're already there. Gliding across the sea. That's when perfection happens. That's when time stopsand your heart opens. And it may only be for a second, but once it collapses, all you need to do is paddle out and capture it all over again. And again. And again. And again. — 〝Carol & The End Of The World〞,　2023

# Welcome to my homebreak

Hi，我是Kermit，四處追浪的正腳開發者 Regular dev，經常出沒於苗栗外埔 :LiLaugh: 

在這裡，我希望記錄下整合探索各種筆記、工具的流程，以及日常中突如其來的想法：可能衝浪相關，可能書籍讀後心得，也不排斥產出技術相關文章。
