>〝When you're up on your board, you're alive, safe in the stillness of summer, speeding towards the infinite. There is no reward or prize. Nothing to chase or find. You're already there. Gliding across the sea. That's when perfection happens. That's when time stopsand your heart opens. And it may only be for a second, but once it collapses, all you need to do is paddle out and capture it all over again. And again. And again. And again.〞
